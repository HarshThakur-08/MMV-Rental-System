# MMV-Rental-System

# Introduction:
Due to enormous population, we all have experienced traffic problems especially in urban areas.A major solution to this problem keeping in mind climate change is using electric bikes as they shift our use from petrol to eco-friendly E-bikes.These E-bikes offer low cost, energy efficient, and emission-free transportation which also has physical and health benefits.

# Objective:
The main objective of this project is provide an interface to people through which we can rent these E bikes to them. 
Features of our program would include:
Log-In System
Entry of a New Customer
Interactive Menu
Booking of E-bike
Cancelling bookings
Returning E-bike
SPECIAL FEATURES
Everyone has unique username.
A person having age less than 10 canâ€™t ride an E-bike.
If a person has forgotten his password then he can enter a security-pin of 4-digits to login into the system.
User can change his password if he is unable to login into the system.
With the help of circular queue using arrays(data structure) we will store the E bikes with their unique id. Also the user details like user-id ,password ,security-pin ,name and age would be stored using data structures.
 If the user is logging into the system first time ,then he  can add his details like first-name, last-name, age , username , password and security-pin  to the system .
After all user authentication, one can book an e-bike and system will allot the available bike to the user. 
On availability of an E bike, one would be allotted to the user. Or the user can cancel the booking at any time as well as return the bike after ride .
